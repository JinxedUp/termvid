# Termvid
### Video player that runs in the terminal with the ability to render the generated ascii video from the terminal back to an .mp4 file with audio.

# USAGE
```
python3 main.py <videoname.extension>
```
## To render using symbols use the ```--ascii``` argument like this:
```
python3 main.py <videoname.extension> --ascii
```
### To save the rendered video from the terminal you will have to wait until the video is over, then the script will ask you if you would like to save it or not by typing y/n
